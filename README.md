Welcome to my 1st Official Project!

Notes:
1. React requires gh dev dependency, scripts, and a remote repository. This is not up and running yet.
2. The index.html file has been updated to include CSS code in place of React code.
3. The actual project on Visual Studio Code is located inside a my-app folder, with a public folder containing index.html, styles.css, and some images.
4. This project may be updated in the future if React is figured out.
